    abstract = {Oak gall wasps typically exhibit a life cycle with one sexual and one asexual generation each year. These wasps can carry various endosymbionts, one of which is the maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia that can induce several reproductive manipulations on its host. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) has been described as the most prominent of these manipulations. CI leads to embryonic mortality in the hosts’ offspring when infected males mate with either uninfected females or with females that harbour different Wolbachia strains. It has been hypothesized that Wolbachia can induce CI in oak gall wasps. To address this hypothesis, we derived a mathematical model to investigate the spread of a bacterial infection in naive populations and to determine the plausibility of CI occurrence. To validate our model, we used published data from Wolbachia-infected Belonocnema kinseyi populations in two approaches. Our first approach uses measurements of infection frequencies and maternal transmission in the sexual generation. For the second approach, we extended the model to compare predictions to estimates of mtDNA-haplotypes, which, like Wolbachia, are maternally inherited, and can therefore be associated with the infection. Both approaches indicate that CI is present in these populations. Our model can be generalized to investigate the occurrence of CI not only for oak gall wasps but also for other species.},
